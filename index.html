                    view all dogs, change information, and copy information from a file into the database. The method used to organize the data was a hash table. </p>

                <p>These projects included assignments that had to do with accessing your computer systems to do different types of task. There were simple ones that listed all the files in directories shown in assignment 1, to assignments including multithreading and doing server to client communication using the UDP protocol. 
                    All of these projects were done in C and were compiled using the gcc compiler.

                <p>This was more of a physical project than a coding project. It involved me going through multiple planning steps to build a karaoke machine that used an aux cord to play music and dials that controlled the volume, tone, and acted as a mixer. The board also included LEDs that displayed the volume, which was also controlled on the PCB board.
